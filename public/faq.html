            <h4>1. What is SharpNEAT</h4>
            <p>
                SharpNEAT provides an implementation of an
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm">Evolutionary Algorithm</a> (EA)
                with the specific goal of evolving neural networks. The EA uses the evolutionary mechanisms of mutation,
                recombination, and selection to search for neural networks with behaviour that satisfies some formally defined
                problem. Example problems might be how to control the limbs of a simple biped or quadruped to make it walk,
                how to control a rocket to maintain vertical flight, or finding a network that implements some desired digital logic
                (such as a multiplexer).
            </p>
            <p>
                A notable point is that NEAT and SharpNEAT search both neural network structure (network nodes and connectivity)
                and connection weights (inter-node connection strength). This is distinct from algorithms such as back-propagation
                that generally attempt to discover good connection weights for a given structure.
            </p>
            <p>
                SharpNEAT is a kit of parts that facilitate research into evolutionary computation, and specifically evolution of neural networks.
                The code as released provides a number of example problem domains that demonstrate how the various parts
                can be wired together to produce a complete working EA. Alternatively researchers can swap in alternative parts, such as a
                new/alternative genetic coding or even a new evolutionary algorithm. The provision for such rewiring was a
                major design goal of SharpNEAT and is facilitated by abstractions made in SharpNEAT's architecture around key concepts
                such as genome (genetic representation and coding) and evolutionary algorithm (mutations, recombination, selection strategy).
            </p>
            <p>
                Motivation for the development of SharpNEAT mainly came from a broader interest in biological evolution, and more
                specifically curiosity on what the limits of neuro-evolution are in terms of the level of problem complexity it can
                produce satisfactory solutions for.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4>2. What is NEAT?</h4>
            <p>
                NEAT is Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies, a neuroevolution technique
                devised by Kenneth Stanley while part of the Neural Networks Research Group, University
                of Texas at Austin. The main NEAT website is hosted by Ken Stanley at <a href="http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/">http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                One of major features of NEAT is its genetic coding of networks, each node and connection is assigned an ID, this
                can be used to 'line-up' the structural parts of networks when performing genetic recombination. This feature
                of NEAT addresses the problem of how to perform meaningful genetic recombination between two network structures without having
                to perform computationally expensive structural matching/alignment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another major feature of NEAT is the use of speciation - the clustering of genomes into species, each of which exists as a partially
                independent sub-population that aims to partially protect its members from competition with the wider population. The motivation for this
                mechanism is the desire to foster genetic diversity, that is, to allow low scoring (weak) genomes to survive if they represent some degree
                of novelty compared to the wider population.
            </p>
            <br />

            <h4>3. What types of problem is NEAT applicable to?</h4>
            <p>
                There is no definitive answer here as research into NEAT is ongoing and
                there have been varying degrees of success reported. Significant problem
                domains that I know of for which good or near-perfect solutions have been
                found are; Single and Double Pole Balancing, Finless Rocket Control, Prey
                Capture, The 3/6 and 11-Multiplexer logic problems.
                Note however that a significant number of problems do not have a 'perfect'
                solution as such, just good and bad solutions. E.g. in game playing experiments
                it is common to use co-evolution where fitness is evaluated by networks
                competing against each other, the fitness scores are therefore only indications
                of relative fitness not overall ability to play a game.
            </p>
            <p>
                One very basic requirement when considering an experiment is that a fast
                method of evaluating fitness must be available for the problem at hand.
                This is so that NEAT can evaluate as many candidate networks as possible
                within a given time period. The more evaluations that can be performed
                the greater the probability of finding a good solution (all other factors being equal).
                E.g. if the fitness function is a simple mathematical equation, or if it involves playing a short/fast
                game (such as tic-tac-toe) entirely within code, then we can evaluate networks
                very quickly and therefore evaluate a large number of networks in a given
                time period. If however the fitness function requires interaction with a person
                or some physical system external to the CPU, then the chances are that
                not enough evaluations can be performed for NEAT to be successful within
                a reasonable amount of time. However, there may be exceptions to even this
                rule, if say a very simple topology is capable of solving a problem then
                it may be discoverable within very few evaluations.

            <ul>
                <li>Single &amp; Double Pole Balancing (Cart and Pole)</li>
                <li>Inverted Double Pendulum</li>
                <li>Function regression (abs, sin, sin(x^2), log(x), multiplication)</li>
                <li>Binary 3/6/11 Multiplexer (NEAT)</li>

            </ul>
            <p>
                An explanation for each experiment is available within the SharpNEAT
                GUI, just select an experiment in the drop-down combobox and click the
                button marked '?'.
            </p>
            <br />

            <h4>5. How do I perform an experimental run using one of the provided problem domains?</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Run the SharpNEAT GUI executable (SharpNeat.Windows.App.exe)</li>
                <li>Select an experiment in the drop-down list.</li>
                <li>Click the button marked 'Load Default Search Parameters'.</li>
                <li>
                    Select one of the 'Initialize Population' menu options. For starters
                    just click 'Auto Generate' and 'OK'.
                </li>
                <li>Click the 'Start/Continue' button.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                You should now see progress information being written to the log window,
                there are also some extra monitor windows available via the 'Visualization'
                Menu.
            </p>
            <br />

            <h4>6. What is Phased Searching?</h4>
            <p>
                Within the SharpNEAT Windows UI, on the 2nd tab page there is a checkbox with
                the label 'Enable Pruning' which is checked by default. This enables a
                process whereby the average complexity of genomes in the population is
                tracked, and if it passes some threshold then the search switches to a
                'pruning' mode. In pruning mode the search continues as normal but additive
                mutations are disabled and deletion mutation rates are increased; this
                causes the average structural complexity of genomes in the population to fall
                but without loosing the best genomes. This can give rise to new bursts
                of improvement in fitness and also a speed up of the search, since more
                complex genomes take longer to evaluate. For a more complete explanation
