    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        An evolutionary algorithm (EA) is applied to a given problem task for a fixed amount of clock time. The state of the EA is
        then read (sampled), and the EA is reset and run again with a different random seed. This process is repeated a large
        number of times resulting in a set of samples from which histograms can be constructed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most notably a histogram of the best fitness achieved in each EA invocation captures and describes the efficacy of an EA
        on a given task, i.e. the range of best fitness scores achieved and their relative frequency when the EA is run multiple
        times.
    </p>

            Generative Sinewave (right).</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br/>
    <p>
        When applied to the same task different EAs will result in different histograms, thus efficacy sampling provides a means
        of comparing efficacy of different EAs (or variants of an EA) on the same task. In particular, if some change to
        an EA were to effect its operation in any significant way then the shape of the histogram it produces will change,
        even though various simple statistics may not necessarily change, such as median or mean best fitness. That is, a
        histogram gives a richer description of the efficacy of an EA on a task than simple statistics or moments.
    </p>
    <br/>

    <h3>Efficacy</h3>
    <p>
        The definitive measure of an EA's efficacy is the speed at which it can find solutions for a given amount of computing resource.
        I.e. the ultimate goal of any search algorithm is to find what is being sought as quickly as possible on a given
        computing hardware platform. As such the term efficacy is used in this paper to refer to the overall performance
        of an evolutionary algorithm, resulting from a combination of the innate or direct efficacy of the algorithm (does
        it work) and its speed of execution, e.g. does the software make good use of available hardware acceleration.
    </p>
    <p>
        E.g. efficacy sampling provides a means of comparing an EA that finds good solutions but that executes very slowly, with
        a poor EA that executes very quickly, such that overall the two algorithms may give similar results in a given amount
        of clock time.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is necessary to take this combined efficacy and speed approach because the overall efficacy of an EA is typically dependent
        on indirect or second order dynamics, such as the interaction between a mutation rate and a crossover rate, or different
        types of mutation, or any number of other EA parameter variations and combinations thereof. E.g. if a crossover rate
        is increased then the crossover execution path will be executed more often, and therefore the speed of that code
        path becomes more relevant to the efficacy of the EA as a whole.
    </p>
    <p>
        Or, a certain type of mutation may influence the size and complexity of the evolved solutions. In turn the speed of the decode
        phase (if one is required) and phenotype code execution (e.g. a neural network implementation) becomes more or less
        relevant in an overall efficacy measure if the genome size is larger or smaller on average.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, certain algorithms may inherently run faster on certain types of CPU (e.g. AMD versus Intel CPUs), perhaps because
        some CPU has more floating point units and the computation is floating point maths heavy; or maybe some EA has specific
        optimizations using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD">SIMD</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_processor">vector instructions</a>,
        or GPU resources, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        The resulting complex set of interactions and dynamics can be measured effectively by a high level efficacy measure as defined
        in this paper. Performance of individual subroutines still matters, but the degree to which they matter varies in
        complex ways depending on many different factors.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>Histograms</h3>
    <p>
        A histogram can be constructed for a continuous variable by dividing the continuous range of the variable into multiple contiguous
        discrete sub-ranges (or 'bins') and counting samples into those bins, thus describing the relative frequency of samples
        in each bin. In this mode a histogram is essentially an approximation of some underlying true continuous distribution;
        an approximation that approaches the true distribution as the sample count approaches infinity and the bin range
        approaches zero (i.e. with narrowing bin range).
    </p>
    <p>
        The efficacy of an EA on a given task has such a continuous underlying distribution that is essentially sampled by construction
        of a histogram. Of note is that the histograms produced by efficacy sampling often contain a large proportion of
        samples within a very narrow range or at a single value. This occurs because some proportion of the EA invocations
        can become 'stuck' at the same fitness level. Hence a histogram may essentially be representing both a discrete distribution
        (the number of samples from some single special case scenario), and a continuous distribution.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the true underlying continuous distribution the special case occurs as a distinct spike, whereas in a histogram the samples
        in the spike fall within the range of one of the bins and are therefore 'averaged down', manifesting as a slightly
        higher frequency in one of the bins rather than as a distinct spike. Such an effect can be observed in the binary11
        multiplexer histogram in figure 1. This effect can be mitigated somewhat by taking more samples and reducing the
        bin range.
    </p>

    <br />

    <h3>Hardware Acceleration and Dependencies</h3>
    <p>
        As described above, the efficacy measure defined in this paper incorporates the execution speed of an EA, which in turn is
        dependent on the computing hardware on which the algorithm runs and whether the software has any particular optimizations
        when running on that hardware. As such, in order to make direct comparisons between different EAs they must be executed
        on the same computing hardware, and ideally they would all make use of any acceleration primitives (e.g. SIMD instructions)
        available on that hardware.
    </p>
    <p>
        If some EA does not make use of available acceleration primitives then it is at an immediate disadvantage relative to EAs
        that do. Ideally we would seek to eliminate these differences such that we are comparing high level algorithms and
        not implementation details. Ultimately however if some EA implementation provides significant optimizations and another
        doesn't, then the efficacy measure will favour the faster code; this is intentional and by design, i.e. the efficacy
        measure reflects real world performance, not hypothetical performance should additional performance optimizations
        be made.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>EA Parameters</h3>
    <p>
        An evolutionary algorithm will typically have a number of parameters such as population size and mutation and crossover rates.
    </p>
    <p>
        When comparing two or more EA implementations it is necessary to choose a set of parameters for each EA that are considered
        good choices (or in fact the best choice possible) for each of those EAs, independently of the choices made for the
        other EAs. That is, each implementation should be configured using the best knowledge available regarding how to
        achieve the best results for that EA. Specifically, it is not necessary to match parameters, e.g. if two EAs both
        have a mutation rate then it is not necessary to configure the rates to be equal when comparing those EAs.
    </p>
    <br/>

    <h3>Stopping Conditions</h3>
    <p>
        Two stopping conditions have been chosen as being particularly useful. (1) The passage of a fixed amount of clock time; (2)
        The execution of a fixed number of generations. Note however that not all EAs are 'generational' in nature, hence
        (2) may not be possible for all EAs.
    </p>
    <p>
        These two modes of sampling measure different aspects of efficacy. A clock time stopping condition gives the definitive measure
        of efficacy. However, using the generation count stopping condition may be useful for comparing results from a single
        EA implementation running on different hardware, such that the speed of the hardware is factored out of the efficacy
        measure. Note however that such a comparison is valid only for the exact same EA implementation (with the exact same
        parameters), otherwise a parameter change may cause the EA to perform a qualitatively different search which may
        lead to the number of generations having a poor correlation with actual resource usage (e.g. consider the increased
        resource usage when genomes rapidly become very large, versus staying relatively small).
    </p>
    <br/>

    <h3>Standard Tasks</h3>
    <p>
        Two standard tasks were chosen for efficacy sampling experiments in this paper; (1) Binary11 Multiplexer; (2) Generative
        Sinewave.
    </p>

    <h5>Binary11 Multiplexer</h5>
    <p>
        Eleven binary inputs are defined as three 'selector' inputs that between them can take one of eight binary values; and eight
        'signal' inputs. A single binary output is required to take the value of the signal input that is selected for by
        the three selector inputs. Evaluation is performed by enumerating all 2<sup>11</sup> (=2048) possible input
        combinations and testing for the correct response at the single output.
    </p>
    <p>
        Binary11 Multiplexer is a highly non-linear task and as such is challenging for neural network based EAs. It is however very
        fast to execute, hence computing resource can be largely devoted to executing the evolutionary search algorithm rather
        than task specific code.
    </p>
    <h5>Generative Sinewave</h5>
    <p>
        In this task there are no inputs and a single continuous output that is required to generate a sinewave in the time dimension.
        This task therefore requires phenomes to have internal state that they can update, and is therefore suitable for
        testing the evolution of cyclic/recurrent neural networks. This task is also very fast to evaluate, requiring trivial
        amounts of CPU and RAM.
    </p>

    <h3>Experiment 1: Efficacy Sampling of SharpNEAT</h3>
    <p>
        SharpNEAT (<a href="https://github.com/colgreen/sharpneat/releases/tag/v2.2.4">version 2.2.4</a>) was applied to
        the two standard tasks defined above. The specific search parameters and hardware platform details are listed below
        (appendix 1). A stopping condition of 60 seconds of clock time was used, and EA statistics read at the end of those
        60 seconds. Histograms of best fitness are shown in figure 1 (above).
    </p>
    <p>
        Further histograms of generation count and total evaluation count (also at 60 seconds) are shown in figures 2 and 3.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <br/>

    <h3>Experiment 2: Efficacy of Crossover Recombination</h3>
    <p>
        NEAT employs crossover recombination as a key part of its evolutionary search strategy. SharpNEAT has a long standing default
        crossover rate setting of 50%, i.e. 50% of offspring (new genomes) in each generation are produced by application
        of crossover recombination applied to two randomly selected parent genomes. The remaining 50% of genomes are produced
        by mutation of randomly chosen single parent genomes.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this experiment SharpNEAT is applied to the same two tasks as in experiment 1, with all of the same parameters except
        for the crossover rate which is set to 0%; i.e. all new genomes are produced by genome mutation only. The resulting
        histograms of best fitness are show in figure 4 overlaid with the histograms from experiment 1.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <figure>
        <img src="efficacy-sampling/binary11-fitness-60sec-xover-hist.png" />
        <img src="efficacy-sampling/sinewave-fitness-60sec-xover-hist.png" />
        <figcaption><b>Figure 4.</b><br/>Histograms of best fitness at 60 seconds for two tasks:<br/> Binary11 Multiplexer (left), and Generative
            Sinewave (right).</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br/>

    <p>
        Note that both tasks result in qualitatively distinct histograms for the two crossover rates. The Binary11 Multiplexer task
        appears to become stuck at a low fitness score approximately twice as frequently when crossover is disabled. However,
        some of the highest scores in the histogram also occur more frequently (with crossover is disabled).
    </p>
    <p>
        In the Generative Sinewave task it is the 50% crossover rate that appears to result in fitness becoming 'stuck' at lower
        scores approximately twice as frequently. However, once again disabling crossover results in higher frequencies for
        some of the highest scores. Interestingly the very highest scores in both tasks are achieved by the 50% crossover
        rate, thus these experiments suggest that crossover results in a complex mix of benefits and disadvantages, rather
        than clearly being beneficial or disadvantageous overall.
    </p>
    <br/>

    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>
        The primary motivation for the development of efficacy sampling is the ongoing development of SharpNEAT; in particular as
        a means of evaluating proposed modifications and enhancements, but also as a high level test when making more significant
        changes to the software. That is, efficacy sampling can be used to ensure that a newer code base continues to work
        at least as well as previous versions of the software, and that no inadvertent subtle defects have been introduced.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, it is hoped that the general approach may be useful to the wider evolutionary search research community.

    <h3>Appendix 1: SharpNEAT and Task Parameters</h3>

        Experiments 1 and 2 were run using SharpNEAT's default parameters, except for experiment 2 in which the crossover rate was
        set to 0%. The full set of parameters and all of the source code used for these experiment is available on github
        (
