    <h1 align="center">SharpNEAT 2.3.1</h1>

    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/colgreen/sharpneat/releases/tag/v2.3.1">This version</a> contains no major functional changes. This
        is primarily a marker release for the recording and reporting of efficacy sampler results following a small change to the efficacy
        sampler program's runtime environment, a change that has resulted in a substantial performance improvement, in turn requiring a
        re-run of the efficacy sampling experiments on the two  benchmark tasks in order to obtain baseline results to compare future
        improvements against.
    </p>
    <p>
        The change in question is a config setting added to the standard .NET application config file that enables a 'server' garbage 
        collection (GC) algorithm. Without this setting the default 'client' GC algorithm is used, and this seems wholly unsuitable
        for the intensive multi-threaded CPU workload that SharpNEAT results in.
    </p>
    <p>
        In particular the client mode GC will sporadically crash with the following error:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
    System.ExecutionEngineException occurred HResult=0x80131506
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        This crash sometimes occurs within a few minutes of running efic.exe (the efficacy sampler program that runs SharpNEAT in a
        continuous loop); on other occasions it has occurred several days into execution. Using the server mode GC so far appears to
        have resolved this problem, and has also resulted in a significant increase in overall execution speed. The relevant config 
        setting is:
    </p>
    <pre>
    &lt;runtime&gt;
      &lt;gcServer enabled="true"/&gt;
    &lt;/runtime&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
        Note that the main SharpNEAT GUI program already contains this setting. It was omitted in error when creating the efficacy sampler
        program.
    </p>
    <p>
        Essentially the client mode GC contains a defect, but one that only occurs when using that GC in an environment to which it is not
        well suited, hence the performance loss. However it is possible to side step the issue by using the GC algorithm more suited to 
        SharpNEAT's CPU workload.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is my understanding that the client GC attempts to maximize responsiveness of interactive programs, as such it will attempt to 
        perform some GC activity concurrently with the running program threads; whereas the server GC uses a more traditional approach of freezing
        all program threads before performing GC activity. The server GC could result in pauses and stutter in a UI based application, but is more suited
        to CPU intensive workloads because it results in better performance overall, and less thread context switching and thread sync lock blocking.
    </p>

    <h2>Summary of Other Changes</h2>

    <h4>Added OutputSignalArray and OutputMappingSignalArray</h4>
    <p>
        These two new classes ensures that the neural net output values are always in the interval [0,1] even if the activation output interval
        is beyond that range. This in turn removes the requirement that activation functions output in the interval [0,1], which allows for 
        performance optimisations in their implementations.
    </p>

    <h4>Activation functions review and clean-up</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Renames:
            <ul>
                <li>SteepenedSigmoid -> LogisticFunctionSteep</li>
                <li>SteepenedSigmoidApproximation -> QuadraticSigmoid</li>
                <li>BoundedLeakyReLU -> SReLU</li>
                <li>BoundedLeakyReLUCentered -> SReLUShifted</li>
                <li>InverseAbsoluteSigmoid -> SoftSignSteep</li>
                <li>PlainSigmoid -> LogisticFunction</li>
                <br/>
            </ul>            
        </li>
        <li>Removed activation functions:
            <ul>
                <li>Absolute</li>
                <li>AbsoluteRoot</li>
                <li>ReducedSigmoid</li>
                <li>StepFunction</li>
                <br/>
            </ul>
        </li>
    
        <li>New activation functions:
            <ul>
                <li>PolynomialApproximantSteep</li>
                <br/>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The following experiments/tasks have been reverted to use the default activation function:
            <ul>
                <li>SinglePoleBalancingExperiment</li>
                <li>InvertedDoublePendulumExperiment</li>
                <li>SinglePoleBalancingBox2dExperiment</li>
                <li>WalkerBox2dExperiment</li>
                <br/>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Efficacy Sampling Tests</h2>
    <p>
        Efficacy sampling was performed on the two standard benchmark tasks and the results compared between this and the previous version 
        (<a href="https://github.com/colgreen/sharpneat/releases/tag/v2.3.0">version 2.3.0</a>).
        The resulting best fitness histograms are provided below. To recap, these histograms show the best fitness achieved on each 
        of a large number of independent SharpNEAT runs, terminating after one minute of execution. Histograms are also provided
        comparing the evaluation counts achieved in each 60 second run.
    </p>

    <br/>

    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p>
        The evaluation count histograms demonstrate the substantial performance improvement obtained by enabling the server mode
        garbage collection algorithm. The Generative Sinewave task has obtained the greatest performance boost, and this is likely 
        because it spends proportionally more time in the NEAT algorithm (reproduction, mutation, crossover, speciation, etc.)
        compared to the Binary11 task, which spends proportionally more time in the neural network activation code, and is therefore
        more responsive to performance improvements in the neural network code (which operates on a static neural net model with minimal
        need for memory allocatiosn and thus garbage collection)
    </p>
    <p>
        It is hoped that the efficacy sampling evidence provided will form a good baseline for future releases to be compared against.
